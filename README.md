## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Configuration

The application connects to a Supabase backend for data storage. Configure your environment variables:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-key
```

## Workflow

1. Upload an EagleView PDF to extract measurements
2. Review the measurements in the Measurements tab
3. Create a new estimate from the measurements
4. Select materials and configure pricing
5. Save the estimate and share with the customer

## Technologies

- React + TypeScript
- Vite for development and building
- Shadcn UI components
- Supabase for backend storage

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).

## Project Roadmap (as of 6/10/2025)

This section outlines the strategic initiatives for the 3MG Estimating Tool, based on business goals and recent development analysis. Our primary goal is to prepare the tool for a company-wide rollout by July.

### üìç Initiative 1: Core Logic & Foundational Fixes (Immediate Priority)

These are critical issues that must be addressed to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the platform.

- **[ ] Change Profit Calculation from Markup to Margin:**
  - **Task:** Update the core profit calculation formula.
  - **Context:** This is a fundamental business logic change requested by the GM.
  - **Action:** Identify the current formula and change it to the correct margin formula.

- **[ ] Fix Flat Roof Labor & Waste Calculations:**
  - **Task:** Correct the labor and material waste calculations specifically for low-slope/flat roof areas.
  - **Context:** Essential for generating accurate material orders from "sold" estimates.

- **[ ] Resolve Preset Bundle Application Bug:**
  - **Task:** Debug the state management issue in the `MaterialsSelectionTab` component.
  - **Context:** Our E2E test has confirmed that applying a material preset does not correctly update the UI. This is a critical bug.
  - **Action:** Fix the state flow between `Estimates.tsx` and `MaterialsSelectionTab.tsx`.

### üì± Initiative 2: Mobile-First Responsive UI (High Priority)

To support reps in the field, the application must be fully functional and easy to use on mobile phones and tablets.

- **[ ] Comprehensive UI Audit & Refactoring:**
  - **Task:** Systematically review every view and component, ensuring it is responsive and usable on small screens.
  - **Priority Areas:**
    - The 5-step estimate workflow (tabs may become a stepper or dropdown on mobile).
    - Data tables (columns should stack vertically).
    - All forms and buttons must be easily tappable.

### ‚ú® Initiative 3: Future Feature Development

These are longer-term goals to be addressed after the initial rollout.

- **[ ] Customer-Facing PDF Proposal Generation:**
  - **Task:** Create a feature to generate a "blue chip / white glove" PDF of the final estimate.
  - **Context:** A key request from the marketing team to enhance the customer experience.

- **[ ] Customer & Estimate Management (CRM-Lite):**
  - **Task:** Allow associating estimates with specific customers.

- **[ ] Expand Sub-Trade Support:**
  - **Task:** Add features for Stucco, siding, painting, solar D&R, screen replacements estimates.

- **[ ] Tile & Metal Roofing Functionality:**
  - **Task:** Add support for different roofing material types, we have shingle now we need metal/tile. 
  
- **[ ] API Integrations:**
  - **Task:** Plan for future integrations with AccuLynx, ServiceTitan, and measurement report providers.

### üß™ Initiative 4: Solidify Testing Framework

A robust testing suite is non-negotiable for an enterprise platform. It ensures we can add features without breaking existing functionality.

- **[ ] Complete and Fix the "Golden Path" E2E Test:**
  - **Task:** Once the preset bundle bug is fixed, get the `create-estimate.spec.ts` test to pass reliably.
  - **Context:** This test validates the entire core user journey.
  
- **[ ] Add Unit Tests for Core Calculations:**
  - **Task:** Implement unit tests for functions like `calculateMaterialQuantity` and `calculateFinalCosts`.
  - **Context:** These tests are fast and ensure our core business logic is always mathematically correct.
