## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Florida Doubling:**

   - Verify underlayment quantities are doubled
   - Check for ðŸŒ´ FL Double Coverage badges

   - Check "Upgrade to Full Peel & Stick System"
   - Verify:
     - FeltBuster is removed
     - MaxFelt NC is removed (if present)
     - StormGuard quantity covers entire steep slope area

3. **Test Non-Florida Properties:**

## Important Notes

- Florida doubling applies to ALL underlayments, not just those in packages
