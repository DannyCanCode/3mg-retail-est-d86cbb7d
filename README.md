git commit -m "Merge feature/server-centric-improvements into main"

# Push to main
git push origin main
```

### **Step 3: Verify Netlify Deployment**

   - Verify dashboard displays correctly
   - Test estimate creation workflow
   - Confirm materials tab shows white theme without prices

2. **Login as Territory Manager**:
   - Verify dark theme with price visibility
   - Test estimate approval workflow
   - Check team member display

3. **Login as Admin**:
   - Full system access verification

   - User management functions

## üêõ **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue: Port 5173 Already in Use**
```bash
# Kill the process
lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9

# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

### **Issue: React Fragment Syntax Errors**
- **Cause**: Mismatched JSX tags or unclosed fragments
- **Solution**: Use `<>` and `</>` shorthand instead of `<React.Fragment>`
- **Prevention**: Always match opening and closing tags

### **Issue: Material Cards Moving**
- **Cause**: React re-rendering without stable keys
- **Solution**: Implemented `materialOrder` state to maintain positions
- **Prevention**: Always use stable IDs for list items

### **Issue: White Screen During Navigation**
- **Cause**: Async state updates or missing error boundaries
- **Solution**: Added loading states and error handling
- **Prevention**: Always handle loading and error states

### **Issue: Lost Form Data**
- **Cause**: Component unmounting without state persistence
- **Solution**: Implemented localStorage caching for form data
- **Prevention**: Use `useAutoSave` hook for critical data

## üìä **Database Schema Updates**

### **Recent Migrations**
- `20241227000001_update_job_worksheet_fields.sql`: Added job worksheet fields
- Territory management tables with RLS policies
- Material waste percentage tracking
- Soft delete columns for estimates (pending implementation)

### **Key Tables**
- `profiles`: User profiles with role-based access
- `estimates`: Main estimate data with territory isolation
- `territories`: Territory definitions and assignments
- `materials`: Material pricing and metadata
- `job_worksheets`: Job-specific details and specifications

## üîê **Security Considerations**

### **Role-Based Access Control**
- **Admin**: Full system access
- **Territory Manager**: Territory-specific estimate management
- **Sales Rep**: Create estimates, no price visibility
- **Project Manager**: Similar to sales rep with additional permissions

### **Row Level Security (RLS)**
- All database tables have RLS policies
- Territory-based data isolation
- Role-based visibility rules

### **State Management**
- Debounced updates for sliders
- Memoized expensive calculations
- Efficient re-render prevention

### **Caching Strategy**

- Performance metrics collection
- User behavior analytics
- Funnel analysis for workflows

## üîÑ **Continuous Integration**

- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Component-based architecture

### **Testing Strategy**
- Unit tests for utilities
- Integration tests for workflows
- E2E tests with Playwright
- Manual QA checklist

## üéØ **Future Enhancements**
