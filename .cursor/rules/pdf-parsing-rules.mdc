# PDF Parsing & Measurement Extraction Rules

1. Preserve original data formats:
   - Never modify pitch formats (e.g., "3/12", "6:12") unless explicitly required
   - Store data exactly as extracted from source documents
   - Avoid redundant notation (e.g., never convert "3/12" to "3/12:12")

2. Defensive data handling:
   - Always check if arrays/objects exist before calling methods on them
   - Use Array.isArray() to verify before mapping/filtering
   - Provide default empty arrays/objects when data might be undefined
   - Use optional chaining (?.) and nullish coalescing (??) operators

3. Data structure consistency:
   - Maintain consistent data structures throughout the application flow
   - Document expected formats in interfaces with clear comments
   - Use typed interfaces for all measurement data
   - Never mix object and array formats for the same data

4. Safe data transformation:
   - Add validation checks before format conversions
   - Log data state at critical transformation points
   - Implement graceful fallbacks when expected data is missing
   - Keep transformations simple and reversible when possible

5. UI rendering safeguards:
   - Always use the actual property values in UI, never array indices
   - Include validation checks before rendering tabular data
   - Ensure consistent formatting in all display components
   - Store critical data with DOM recovery mechanisms
