# Job Worksheet Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive digital Job Worksheet (JWS) form for sales reps/project managers to replace the paper form. This includes database schema updates, new React components, and role-based access controls.

## Key Changes

### 1. Database Updates (`supabase/migrations/20241227000001_update_job_worksheet_fields.sql`)
- Added `flat_roof_total_sq` and `pitch_gauge` columns to estimates table
- Created functions to auto-calculate flat roof totals (0/12, 1/12, 2/12 pitches)
- Created function to determine predominant pitch from measurements
- Added trigger to auto-populate these fields when measurements are updated
- Updated job_worksheet_templates table with comprehensive template

### 2. New Components
- **`src/components/estimates/JobWorksheetForm.tsx`**: Complete digital form with tabs:
  - Basic Info: Name, job type, price match, address, leak
  - Property Access: HOA, gate/code, pool, driveway type, R&R structure
  - Shingle Roof: Manufacturer, type, color, warranties, underlayment, decking
  - Ventilation: Goosenecks, boots, ridge vents, off-ridge vents
  - Gutters: Size, color, linear feet, downspouts, screens
  - Solar: Existing, removal, type, company info
  - Accessories: Skylights (removed satellite, attic fan, chimney per request)

### 3. Role Updates
- Added `project_manager` role support to:
  - `src/hooks/useSalesRepRestrictions.ts`: Same permissions as sales_rep
  - `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`: Shows Sales Dashboard and My Estimates
  - Both roles have 35% fixed profit margin (hidden from view)

### 4. Auto-Calculations
- Flat Roof SQ: Automatically sums areas of 0/12, 1/12, 2/12 pitches from measurements
- Pitch Gauge: Automatically determines predominant pitch based on largest area

### 5. Material Mappings (Ready for Implementation)
Based on the paper form, these ventilation items map to existing materials:
- Boots 1.5" → `adjustable-lead-pipe-flashing-1-5inch`
- Boots 2" → `adjustable-lead-pipe-flashing-2inch`
- Gooseneck 4" → `galvanized-gooseneck-4inch`
- Ridge Vent → `gaf-cobra-ridge-vent`

## Notes

- Flat roof calculation only includes 0/12, 1/12, 2/12 pitches (low slope)
- ISO needed checkbox available for flat roof sections
- Form is fully responsive and includes conditional logic (e.g., gate code only shows if gate is checked)
