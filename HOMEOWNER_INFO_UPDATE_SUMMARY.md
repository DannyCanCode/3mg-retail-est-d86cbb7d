### 3. SalesRepEstimateFlow Updates
- **File**: `src/pages/SalesRepEstimateFlow.tsx`
- Updated `handleWorksheetComplete` to extract email and phone from job worksheet
- Updated JobWorksheetForm initial data to include email and phone fields
- Ensures email and phone are properly saved when submitting estimate

## Features Implemented

### Email Field
- HTML5 email input type for browser validation
- Database-level email validation using regex pattern
- Placeholder shows expected format: "homeowner@example.com"

### Phone Field
- Automatic formatting as user types
- Formats to (XXX) XXX-XXXX pattern
- Removes non-numeric characters automatically
- Max length set to 14 characters to match format
- Placeholder shows expected format: "(555) 123-4567"

## Data Flow
1. User enters email and phone in JobWorksheetForm
2. Data is stored in `basic_info.email` and `basic_info.phone`
3. SalesRepEstimateFlow extracts these fields and stores in estimate data
4. When estimate is submitted, email goes to `owner_email` and phone to `owner_phone` columns
5. Database validates email format before saving

## Notes
- The main Estimates page doesn't currently use JobWorksheetForm (only in backup file)
- The changes are primarily for the Sales Rep workflow
- Email validation happens at both frontend (HTML5) and database levels
- Phone formatting is frontend-only, stored as formatted string in database
